## Introduction 

This analysis/challenge was provided by the [Dr. Eliezer Van Allen Lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/), Harvard Medical School & Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. 

In brief, the purpose of this assessment was to analyze processed [Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/Mutation_Annotation_Format/) from [Whole Exome Sequencing](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/d/diagnostic-labs/molecular-genetics/whole-exome-sequencing/families/faq) of cancer patients. 

## Usage 

If you want to reproduce this analysis, check out the `requirements.txt` file. 

Better yet, pull & run the `Docker Image` with the following command: 

`docker run --rm -it -p 9010:8888 yraghav97/tumor-exome-mutation-analysis:v1.1`
